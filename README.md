# Interhouse-Party-Design-2020
Design of the Venerable House Doctor-Who Themed Interhouse Party

The last Saturday of February every year, Venerable House, one of the 8 houses at Caltech, constructs and hosts an interhouse party.
The theme for the 2020 party was Doctor Who, and the dance platforms were constructed to look similar to the inside of a Tardis. 
Six weeks are spent on the construction of the party, a timelapse of which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-tka9Tf5hE

As a Freshman at the time, I focused my energy on the design of the Center Console of the Tardis, which consisted of 6 panels of LEDs
and switches, as well as 6 LED towers displaying the FFT of the dance music (Arduino code developed in collaboration with Ray Sun, 
Caltech EE '20). I committed approximately 100-150 hours to this project in January and February of 2020.
